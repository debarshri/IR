New Power Company and Azurix are other affiliate companies of Enron. EDS is a 
totally different company, to which we have outsourced some stuff - so they 
have a number of employees on our premises ( on EDS contract).

I personally do not work out at the bodyshop. So would be unable to help you 
on how it might be in the morning.  I am sure you can call the BodyShop and 
they can help you out.  If you have questions, our HR co-ordinator (Lauren or 
Ben) should be able to provide further assistance.

Subject: The Body Shop quick question

Harry,

Just a quick question for you, please.

I read the guidelines and included them below regarding the Body Shop.  At 
the beginning of the page, it includes the category of employees to include 
some that I am not familiar with.  Of course, I do see the area for 
contractors, however, I was curious what these classifications are.  Can you 
please let me know what these are?

I just want to be sure on the correct fees prior to making a commitment to 
join with them.  Also, have you ever been to the Body Shop in the morning?  
Do you know if it is super crowded or not?  I can't imagine too many people 
arriving at 5:30am.

Thanks ahead for your input.  I appreciate it.
