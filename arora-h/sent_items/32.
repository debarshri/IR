Tried calling you earlier today but looks like there is something wrong with your phone (x34049).  Unfortunately I will not be able to make it tomorrow , but my colleague Doug Smith (3-9310) who runs our Ercot trading group has agreed to take my spot. 

I told him this was for 2 hours. Can you give me a call and let him know the details. I did give Doug my folder.


Thanks


Harry
