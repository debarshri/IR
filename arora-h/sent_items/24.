I am glad you liked the presentation.

I had a look at the tool-kit - I think it is a good brief description of various products.  I did forward your email to Iris Mack and she might be able to provide you further input on that. She is also available as a resource (as a derivatives specialist) to analyze clients risk and provide solutions.

I would be more than happy to discuss any specific client situations you have and what we could offer to them. Would be happy to sit down and discuss more stuff with you if you are interested.


Harry

Hi Harry,

I heard you speak yesterday at the originator's meeting.  It was rather interesting.  I took the Derivatives 2 course a few weeks ago and they went into the complexities of options trading.  It was cool stuff.  I'd like to know more about options trading and I hope that you can recommend some good sources or books.  I'd appreciate any info you could pass on.  

Also, I'm putting together an "Originator's Toolkit" which consists of the various financial products that the originators and mid marketers could offer to customers.  I'm attaching a list of option based products that I have put together so far.  I'd be grateful if you could take a minute, read through it, and let me know if there are any additional option products that I should include.  I want to make sure the toolkit has as many useful products as possible.

Thanks so much,
Max
