what is the difference between this spark spread function call and the one =
being used in the spreadsheets we use ?

Hi Slava,

=09Paulo says you have some questions about what we're doing with spark spr=
eads.

=09He did not give me any specifics as to what you needed.  Give me at call=
 at X3-6711 for more details.

=09In the mean time, I have been developing exotic options modules/tutorial=
s for the power trading floor.  One of the modules is on spark spreads  - p=
lease see attached file.

=09
Regards,
Iris

Iris:
I think you are the expert on how we are trading spark spreads (if we are d=
oing any). Slava wants to know more about it. I appreciate if you contact h=
im directly.=20
Many Thanks.
Paulo Issler

Paulo,

thank you very much.=20
we will look at all your work.

just to remind you on spark spread options.

many thanks,

Slava

Slava:
Here are the files related to the models I mentioned in our phone coversati=
on.

FwdFwd Vols:

Here is a spreadshet implementing a technique for calculating fwd fwd volat=
ilities for seasonal vol curves. The approach avoids the issue of geting ne=
gative fwd fwd variances when using the traditional approach. It makes nece=
ssary, however, to develop a specific fwd fwd vol curve for each contract m=
onth.=20

Here is how it works:
=091) Create a variance curve: Var =3D vol*vol*(Ti-t)
=092) Fit a desoasonalized curve with functional form: y =3D a*(tb)?=093) c=
alculate fwd-fwd variances for the desoasonal curve:?=094) Calculate fwd-fw=
d vols for each month by multiplying the ?=09    fwd-fwd variance curve by =
a factor equal to:?=09=09=09SQRT(Var(Contract Month)/Var(fit))??? << File: =
FwdFwd.xls >> ?I implemented a C code for calculating that. This, with the =
omicron vols may be used to model the gas curve evolution in a HJM framewor=
