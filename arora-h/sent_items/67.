There has been just too many rumors flying around here to quote real long term deals.  Give me a day or so to put numbers on long dated deals.

Harry:

Any idea when you'll get a chance to respond to these questions?  I'd like to get back to my counterparties ASAP.  Understand you're probably very busy.  Just give me an estimate, if you can.

Regards, Greg

Harry, Iris and Brandon:

Just finished up another call with my counterparty at Dominion.  Here are the opportunities:

1.	GridSouth - (They really want to dump in "CP&L East" - anything we can do to facilitate 	this will better meet customer requirements.

		Capacity:	2003 - 100MW
				2004 - 250MW
				2005 - 570MW for five years

	Will accept day-ahead dispatch.  Really want 8 hour minimum runs w/ 5x16 availability.

		Heat Rate:	7200
		VOM		$2/MWh

2.	Entergy - 

		They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price.

		Capacity:	65MW
		Start Date:	July 2002
		Term:		5 Years
		Price:		$x/MWh

3.	TVA - Peaker

		Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time.

		Capacity:	Tell me what, if any, we can do.
		Start Date:	June 2004
		Availability:	5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar
		Heat Rate:	10,900
		VOM:		$2/MWh

		Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.  If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.  If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.

4.	TVA - Combined Cycle

		This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning 		1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.  This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.  		Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to 		8hrs.

Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.  Thanks for all your work.  I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.

Regards, Greg
