I left a message for Greg, that we'd be prepared to show a 3$ bid if that includes capacity.  I did underline the point that we are not too excited to buy but nevertheless will show an indicative bid.

Let me know if you have any questions.


Harry

Harry,
I'm not sure if you've had a chance to talk to Kevin yet, but Greg just sent this to me.
Give me a call/email if you want to talk it over with me.
Thanks,

Brandon:

Any word from Harry on the Entergy bid?

Also, what do we have on the NEPOOL stuff, anything yet?  If not, I would appreciate a guess as to time frame.

Thanks, 

Greg
