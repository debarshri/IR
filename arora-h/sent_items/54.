All,

You are all confirmed as interviewers for the Trading Track -  November 1st.    We have 33 candidates to be interviewed (a combination of both internal and external candidates).   You will each receive your resumes tomorrow and interview location information (as before it will take place at the Allen Center).  

The interviews will commence at 2.00 pm and finish at 5.:30.   A de-brief, will follow directly afterwards at the Double Tree Hotel (Dover Room) where you will decide on those candidates to be hired into the ENA Trading Track.   Please allow 1/1.5 hours for the de-brief.

Regards,

Karen
